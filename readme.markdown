FAQ
-------------------------------------------------------
= If this theme is premium then why is it here? =
You can download the theme here but you won't get any support. Support is ONLY provided through our support forums, which are locked. You can only post, and view threads if you have purchased a license key. It's only $39 bucks a site, which enables support from the guy who wrote it all himself! The unicorn slayeerrrrrrrr. Cue thunderousy ominous music.
